You need to set the environment variable to find SGCT:
SGCT_ROOT_DIR

Some CMake variables influence the build process:
VISCOM_CLIENTGUI
VISCOM_CLIENTMOUSECURSOR
VISCOM_SYNCINPUT
VISCOM_CONFIG_NAME (Name of the configuration [=subfolders in config + data directories] to use)

Some config files may also need to be adjusted:
- framework.cfg -> Configuration file used when running the application from the root directory.
VISCOM_CONFIG (== VISCOM_CONFIG_NAME)
PROGRAM_PROPERTIES (just change the configuration folder to VISCOM_CONFIG_NAME, the filename is always the same)
SGCT_CONFIG (filename of the SGCT configuration file)
PROJECTOR_DATA (see PROGRAM_PROPERTIES)
LOCAL (two possible values: -1 for client/server use; 0 for local only.)

- framework_ide.cfg -> Should mostly be adjusted correctly be CMake.
For values see framework.cfg.

Currently the configurations for 4 windows (quad) and single window (single) are included. The 4 window configuration(s) needs some adjustment of IP adresses...
